# Data Structures and Algorithms

Projects for the Odin Project's [Projects: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms). The `Binary Search Trees` and `Knight's Travails` projects include the use of some data structures and algorithms like: 

* Stacks
* Queues
* Breath-First Search
* Depth-First Search (iterative and recursive)
* Binary Search Trees
* Trees
