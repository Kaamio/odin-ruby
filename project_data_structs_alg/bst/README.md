# Binary Search Trees (BST)

Create and search a Binary Search Tree (for Project 1 of the Odin Project's [Projects: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms).)
Nodes of the BST are objects of the Node class in `node.rb`. 

* `#build_tree` creates a BST from an array of values.

* `#breadth_first_search` uses the BFS algorithm to search for a given value in the BST (returning `nil` if the value is not found).

* `#depth_first_search` uses the iterative DFS algorithm to search for a given value in the BST (returning `nil` if the value is not found).

* `#dfs_rec` uses the recursive DFS algorithm to search for a given value in the BST (returning `nil` if the value is not found).

* `#inorder` and `#inorder_display` are provided to help examine the structure of the BST.

*To see the results of running some tests on the methods above, you can run `ruby bst.rb --tests`.*
